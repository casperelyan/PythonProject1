# Design : 
Very simple designs. Logo in the middle and four buttons with answers to choose from. The same font as in the previous project was used.



# Features :

The project actually consists of two elements. Home page with a Start button that starts the Quiz and a set of questions with answers to choose from. The user is informed about the choice of the correct or wrong answer by the appropriate color of the button and the background - green for correct and red for wrong. The quiz does not have the function of counting good answers, this option will definitely be added at a later stage of the project development. The number of questions will also be increased and a timer will be added.
